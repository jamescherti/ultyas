![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/jamescherti/ultyas)

Ultyas is a command-line tool designed to simplify the process of converting code snippets from UltiSnips (Vim) to YASnippet format (Emacs).

With Ultyas, you can effortlessly migrate your code snippets to the YASnippet format, saving you valuable time and effort.

## Installation

Here is how to install Ultyas locally to `~/.local/bin/ultyas` using pip:
```
pip install --user ultyas
```

## Command usage example

To use Ultyas, simply run the command with the appropriate input and output files. Here is a basic example:

```
~/.local/bin/ultyas ~/.vim/UltiSnips/python.snippets -o ~/.emacs.d/snippets/python-mode/
```

This command takes an UltiSnips file `python.snippets` and converts it to a directory that contains YASnippet snippets at `~/.emacs.d/snippets/python-mode/`.

## Options and flags

```
usage: ultyas <file.snippets> -o <yasnippet-major-mode-dir>

A command-line tool for converting code snippets from UltiSnips to YASnippet format.
